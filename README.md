This is an example upload to a repository from a remote server for my Web Programming class.

In order to push these files to the Github I:
-Linked the Git on my Linux server to the Github

-Used MobaXTerm to move files onto the server

-Called the git add * command to get the files ready to commit

-Called git status to ensure the files I wanted to commit were staged

-Called the git commit -m command with the message "Upload of a few basic HTML files"

-Called the git push origin master command to push the files onto Github

and

https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git

were helpful refreshers but I was already familiar with these git functions going into the assignment from previous SWENG and personal experience.
